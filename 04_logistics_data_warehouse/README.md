## Business Context

In logistics and transportation, operational data is spread across multiple systems - fleet management, dispatch, fuel tracking, maintenance logs, and customer contracts. When these are siloed, operations managers cannot answer basic questions like *"Which driver has the highest on-time rate?"* or *"Which route is the most profitable?"*

**This project solves that problem.**

The **Logistics Data Warehouse** consolidates 14 operational tables from a Class 8 trucking company (2022-2024) into a single analytics-ready platform:

| Business Problem | Engineering Solution |
|---|---|
| Data scattered across fleet, dispatch & finance systems | Unified ingestion pipeline via the Bronze layer |
| Inconsistent formats, NULLs, and bad data types | Standardisation & cleansing in the Silver layer |
| No analytics-ready model | Star Schema dimensional model in the Gold layer |
| No audit trail for data loads | Per-table timing & row-count output on every run |
| No systematic data quality checks | Dedicated `tests/` directory per layer |

---

## Solution Architecture

The warehouse follows the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze -> Silver -> Gold) - a modern layered pattern ensuring data lineage, traceability, and progressive refinement.

## Data Flow

![Data Flow](docs/data_flow.png)

```
[Source CSVs - 14 tables]
       |
       v  BULK INSERT (stored proc: bronze.load_bronze)
[Bronze Tables] -- Raw, untransformed, exact replica of source
       |
       v  ETL stored procedures per table (stored proc: silver.load_silver)
[Silver Tables] -- Cleansed, typed, deduplicated + audit timestamp
       |
       v  Business logic JOINs + surrogate key generation (stored proc: gold.load_gold)
[Gold Layer]    -- Star Schema: 7 dimensions + 5 fact tables
```

---

## Star Schema

The Gold layer implements a **Star Schema** dimensional model optimised for analytical queries. All dimension tables use **surrogate keys** (INT IDENTITY) for fast joins, while retaining natural keys for traceability.

### Dimension Tables

| Table | Source | Key Columns | Enrichments |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gold.dim_driver` | `silver.drivers` | `driver_key` (surrogate), `driver_id` (natural) | `full_name` = first + last |
| `gold.dim_truck` | `silver.trucks` | `truck_key`, `truck_id` | `truck_age_years` = current year - model year |
| `gold.dim_trailer` | `silver.trailers` | `trailer_key`, `trailer_id` | - |
| `gold.dim_customer` | `silver.customers` | `customer_key`, `customer_id` | - |
| `gold.dim_facility` | `silver.facilities` | `facility_key`, `facility_id` | - |
| `gold.dim_route` | `silver.routes` | `route_key`, `route_id` | `lane_description` = origin -> destination |
| `gold.dim_date` | Generated (2020-2030) | `date_key` (YYYYMMDD) | year, quarter, month, week, day, is_weekend |

### Fact Tables

| Table | Grain | Dimension Keys | Key Measures |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gold.fact_trip` | One trip | driver, truck, trailer, customer, route, date | revenue, total_revenue, distance, duration, fuel, MPG |
| `gold.fact_fuel_purchase` | One fuel transaction | driver, truck, date | gallons, price_per_gallon, total_cost |
| `gold.fact_maintenance` | One service record | truck, date | labor_cost, parts_cost, total_cost, downtime_hours |
| `gold.fact_safety` | One incident | driver, truck, date | vehicle_damage_cost, cargo_damage_cost, total_damage_cost, claim_amount |
| `gold.fact_delivery` | One pickup/delivery | facility | detention_minutes, on_time_flag |

## Pipeline Execution

Execute the pipeline **sequentially** - each layer depends on the previous.

### Step 1 - Database Initialisation

> **Warning:** This script drops and recreates the `logistics_dwh` database.

```sql
:r scripts/init_database.sql
```

### Step 2 - Bronze Layer (Raw Ingestion)

```sql
-- Create bronze table schemas (reference, transactions, analytics)
:r scripts/bronze/01_create_reference.sql
:r scripts/bronze/02_create_transactions.sql
:r scripts/bronze/03_create_analytics.sql

-- Register load stored procedures
:r scripts/bronze/04_load_reference.sql
:r scripts/bronze/05_load_transactions.sql
:r scripts/bronze/06_load_analytics.sql
:r scripts/bronze/07_load_bronze_layer.sql
```

Then execute the full pipeline with a single command:

```sql
EXEC bronze.load_bronze;
```

**What happens:** All 14 tables are bulk-loaded from CSV with zero transformation. Per-table timing and row counts are printed on every run. Any re-run will truncate and reload (idempotent).

### Step 3 - Silver Layer (Cleanse & Standardise)

```sql
-- Create silver table schemas (reference, transactions, analytics)
:r scripts/silver/01_create_reference.sql
:r scripts/silver/02_create_transactions.sql
:r scripts/silver/03_create_analytics.sql

-- Register all 14 table load stored procedures
:r scripts/silver/04_load_drivers.sql
:r scripts/silver/05_load_customers.sql
:r scripts/silver/06_load_facilities.sql
:r scripts/silver/07_load_routes.sql
:r scripts/silver/08_load_trailers.sql
:r scripts/silver/09_load_trucks.sql
:r scripts/silver/10_load_delivery_events.sql
:r scripts/silver/11_load_fuel_purchases.sql
:r scripts/silver/12_load_loads.sql
:r scripts/silver/13_load_maintenance_records.sql
:r scripts/silver/14_load_safety_incidents.sql
:r scripts/silver/15_load_trips.sql
:r scripts/silver/16_load_driver_monthly_metrics.sql
:r scripts/silver/17_load_truck_utilization_metrics.sql
:r scripts/silver/18_load_silver_layer.sql
```

Then execute the full pipeline with a single command:

```sql
EXEC silver.load_silver;
```

**What happens:** Each of the 14 Bronze tables is cleansed and loaded into Silver with:
- **TRIM** on all string columns
- **UPPER** standardisation on state codes, VINs, and flags
- **Deduplication** via `ROW_NUMBER()` on primary keys
- **Range validation** on numeric fields (negative values -> NULL)
- **`dwh_create_date`** audit timestamp on every record

### Step 4 - Gold Layer (Star Schema)

```sql
-- Create dimension and fact table schemas
:r scripts/gold/01_create_dimensions.sql
:r scripts/gold/02_create_facts.sql

-- Register load stored procedures
:r scripts/gold/03_load_dimensions.sql
:r scripts/gold/04_load_facts.sql
:r scripts/gold/05_load_gold_layer.sql
```

Then execute the full pipeline with a single command:

```sql
EXEC gold.load_gold;
```

**What happens:** 7 dimension tables are populated from Silver (including a generated date dimension spanning 2020-2030), then 5 fact tables are loaded by JOINing Silver transactional data with dimension surrogate keys. Derived measures like `total_revenue` and `total_damage_cost` are calculated during load.

---

## Full Pipeline (End-to-End)

After all scripts have been registered, the entire warehouse can be refreshed with three commands:

```sql
EXEC bronze.load_bronze;
EXEC silver.load_silver;
EXEC gold.load_gold;
```

---

## Testing & Data Quality

Data quality is a **first-class engineering concern** in this project. Every source table has a corresponding validation script before it is promoted to the next layer.

### Quality Check Dimensions

| Dimension | Checks Performed |
|---|---|
| **Completeness** | NULL checks on mandatory fields (IDs, dates, names) |
| **Uniqueness** | Duplicate detection on primary keys (single & composite) |
| **Validity** | Date logic checks, negative value detection, format validation |
| **Consistency** | Trimming, standardisation of categorical values |
| **Range** | Min/max sanity checks on numeric and date columns |
| **Referential Integrity** | Orphaned foreign key detection (Gold layer) |
| **Reconciliation** | Silver-to-Gold row count matching |

### Test Coverage

| Layer | Script | Table Covered |
|---|---|---|
| Silver | `01_exploration.sql` | Bronze layer - overall profiling |
| Silver | `02_quality_checks_drivers.sql` | `bronze.drivers` |
| Silver | `03_quality_checks_customers.sql` | `bronze.customers` |
| Silver | `04_explore_customer_type.sql` | `bronze.customers` - type analysis |
| Silver | `05_quality_checks_facilities.sql` | `bronze.facilities` |
| Silver | `06_quality_checks_routes.sql` | `bronze.routes` |
| Silver | `07_quality_checks_trailers.sql` | `bronze.trailers` |
| Silver | `08_quality_checks_trucks.sql` | `bronze.trucks` |
| Silver | `09_quality_checks_delivery_events.sql` | `bronze.delivery_events` |
| Silver | `10_quality_checks_fuel_purchases.sql` | `bronze.fuel_purchases` |
| Silver | `11_quality_checks_loads.sql` | `bronze.loads` |
| Silver | `12_quality_checks_maintenance_records.sql` | `bronze.maintenance_records` |
| Silver | `13_quality_checks_safety_incidents.sql` | `bronze.safety_incidents` |
| Silver | `14_quality_checks_trips.sql` | `bronze.trips` |
| Silver | `15_quality_checks_driver_monthly_metrics.sql` | `bronze.driver_monthly_metrics` |
| Silver | `16_quality_checks_truck_utilization_metrics.sql` | `bronze.truck_utilization_metrics` |
| Gold | `01_quality_checks_dimensions.sql` | All 7 dimension tables |
| Gold | `02_quality_checks_facts.sql` | All 5 fact tables |

## Business Questions This Project Answers

- Which drivers have the best on-time delivery rates?
- Which routes are the most profitable?
- How does truck age affect maintenance costs?
- What is the average fuel cost per trip by route?
- Which customers generate the highest revenue?
- How do seasonal patterns affect load volumes and rates?
- What is the fleet utilisation rate per truck per month?
- Which safety incidents were most costly?

## Engineering Decisions

### Why Stored Procedures for ETL?
Stored procedures encapsulate transformation logic close to the data, enabling atomic transactions, built-in error handling (`TRY/CATCH`), execution timing, and row-count logging - all version-controlled like application code.

### Why Truncate-and-Load (Not Incremental)?
For a dataset of this scale (~361K rows), a full truncate-and-reload on each run guarantees idempotency without the complexity of change-data-capture (CDC) or watermark management. The right tradeoff at this scale.

### Why Separate DDL from Load Scripts?
Separating schema creation (`01_create_*.sql`) from data loading (`04_load_*.sql`) means schema changes can be reviewed and deployed independently - load jobs never break because of a DDL modification.

### Why Surrogate Keys in Gold?
Integer surrogate keys (`INT IDENTITY`) are smaller, faster for joins, and independent of source system key changes. Natural keys are retained alongside surrogate keys for traceability and debugging.

### Why a Date Dimension?
A pre-generated calendar table (`gold.dim_date`) enables time-based grouping (year, quarter, month, day, weekend) without runtime date functions - essential for performant analytical queries and BI tool compatibility.

### Why a Tests Directory?
Separating validation logic from production ETL is a senior engineering discipline. The `tests/` directory provides a reusable audit trail of every data quality decision - invaluable for onboarding new engineers and diagnosing future data issues.
